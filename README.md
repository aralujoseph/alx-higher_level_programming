# This README file is for the alx Simple Shell collaboration project

This project is about a Unix shell which is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

 As a team, we are writing a A simple UNIX command interpreter.

Below are lists of the required tasks to achieve the objectives:

0 -  ``` Run Python file ```

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.

The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

1 - ``` Run inline ```

Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

2 - ``` Hello, print ```

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function print

3 - ``` Print integer ```

Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

4 - ``` Print float ```

Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

5 - ``` Print string ```

Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

6 - ``` Play with strings ```

Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!

7 - ``` Copy - Cut - Paste ```

*You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
*Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
*word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
*word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
*middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

8 - ``` Create a new sentence ```

Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.

9 - ``` Easter Egg ```

Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

*Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

10 - ``` Linked list cycle ```

Technical interview question;

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

* Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
* Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
